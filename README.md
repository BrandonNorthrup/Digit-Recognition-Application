# Digit-Recognition-Application
To install this project, first download and read the User Manual. It explains how to install Anaconda/Jupyter 
so that you may view and use the Digit Recognition App in Jupyter Notebooks.

The "Digit Recognition - Hereditary Cancer.pdf" file is a file that was created to pose as 
real software engineering documentation for the project. It is not needed in any way to
run the application, but you should take a look at it if you want to better understand
why everything works the way it does, as well as what the graphs mean.
